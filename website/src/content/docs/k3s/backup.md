title: K3S backup
---

## Steps

### Backup

* Always back up your token.
* If you're using
  * etcd snapshots, take snapshots and back them up somewhere.
  * sqlite, stop the server and back up the sqlite files.
  * an external database, back that up.
* If you have persistent volumes, use whatever tool your storage vendor recommends.

### Restoration

To roll back a K3s cluster when using a SQLite database, replace the `.db` file with the copy of the `.db` file you made
while backing up your database.

Restoring the `state.db` file works (as long as the `shm` and `wal` files are deleted before restore).
See [k3s-datastore](datastore-sqlite.md)

## Related Rollback

You can roll back the K3s Kubernetes version after an upgrade, using a combination of

* K3s binary downgrade
* and datastore restoration.
