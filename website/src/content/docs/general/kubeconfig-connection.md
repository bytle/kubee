`kubeconfig` is the file that permits to connect to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Structure

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
  - cluster:
      certificate-authority-data: LS0tL
      server: https://x.x.x.x:6443
    name: clustert-name
contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: cluster-name
      user: default
    name: default@cluster-name
current-context: default@cluster-name
users:
  - name: default
    user:
      client-certificate-data: LS0tLS...
      client-key-data: LS0t...
```

It contains:

* cluster information
* user information
* and context (a pair of cluster and user information)

### Context

The context is the pair user / cluster that is used to connect.


## Order of Precedence

Kubee search the kubeconfig file in the following order:

* the `KUBECONFIG` env
* the default kubeconfig file `~/.kube/config`
* in the [pass](kubeconfig-pass.md) at `$KUBEE_PASS_HOME/kubeconfig/$KUBEE_CONTEXT_NAME`

## Context check for cluster connection

To be sure that the command are executed against the required cluster,
kubee checks that the kubeconfig current context is equal to the [KUBEE_CONTEXT_NAME](kubee-env.md#kubee_context_name).

ie the expected value should be:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters: [ ]
contexts: [ ]
users: [ ]
current-context: "$KUBEE_CONTEXT_NAME"
```

If it's not the case, it will try to change it and if it does not succeed, it will exit.

## How To

### How to see the kubeconfig file

```bash
# with the cert cached
kubee kubectl config view
# with all data
kubee kubectl config view --raw
```

### How to test a connection

```bash
kubee kubectl cluster-info
```

### How to encrypt

We allow also to store in encrypted with [pass](kubeconfig-pass.md)
