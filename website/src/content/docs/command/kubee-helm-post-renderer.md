[//]: # (% kubee-helm-post-renderer&#40;1&#41; Version Latest | A Helm Post renderer)

## NAME

`kubee-helm-post-renderer` is a  [helm post renderer](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering)
that adds support for:

* `Jsonnet`
* and `kustomize`

## HOW IT WORKS

- if a `jsonnet` directory exists at the root of the chart directory
  - if a `jsonnetfile.json` is present, the `jsonnet bundler` is executed to fetch dependencies
  - the `jsonnet` files present in the `jsonnet` directory are executed
  - the output are added to the Helm templates
- if a `kustomization.yml` is present at the root of the chart directory
  - the environment variables present in `kustomization.yml` are substituted
  - the templates are rendered
  - `kustomize` is applied
  - the output is added to the Jsonnet templates if present

## JSONNET

See [kubee jsonnet-project](../helmet/jsonnet-project.md)
