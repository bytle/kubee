		All charts are Helm compatible. 
    The kubee chart manager, [helmet](helmet/index.md) is just an Helm Wrapper
    with a post-processing plugin that adds support for jsonnet and kustomize.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Single VPS Optimized" icon="document">
		Kubee was build with the constraint resource of a Single VPS.
    The default kubernetes distribution is [k3s](k3s/index.md) and
    all default chart values are set to minimize memory and cpu consumption.
    A whole Prometheus installation takes a maximum of 400Mo memory.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Just Bash, no Lock in" icon="add-document">
		Kubee is implemented with bash scripts. 
    You can fork it, modify it and make it your own.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Single Cluster Value file " icon="setting">
    The whole cluster configuration is done in a [single values file](cluster/cluster-values.md).
	</Card>
