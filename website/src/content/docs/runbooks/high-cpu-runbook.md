title: High CPU Runbook
---

## About

System should run at a reasonable:

* CPU utilization level (e.g. 20-30%)
* and load average of 2-3.

## CPU Analytics

Since k3s runs everything on the host (not in VMs), the problematic process will show up directly in top.

k3s is the parent process for all containers,
you need to drill down to see which pod/container is actually consuming resources

### Top

Get access to the node

* Ssh
* Start a container

```bash
kubectl debug node/<node-name> -it --image=ubuntu
# Then inside the container:
chroot /host
```

Then start top

```bash
top
# or
top -c -o %CPU
```

or

```bash
htop
```

#### Load average

The load of 3.01 per core is quite high - typically you want it below 1.0 per core.
Since it's sustained over 15 minutes, this suggests an ongoing issue rather than a temporary spike.
A load of 3.01 per core suggests either CPU-bound processes or significant I/O blocking.

Example:

* normal (usually sit between about 1.0 and 3.0.)

```
load average: 0.87, 1.56, 1.35
```

* high (around 8-9, getting worse over time)

```
load average: 5.40, 10.09, 11.80
```

A high load average can be caused by:

* Memory thrashing: System is constantly swapping because you have no swap space and RAM is 95%+ full
* Processes are blocking waiting for memory/I/O

#### Swapping ? kswapd0, wa

* If `kswapd0` is using CPU, this kernel process swaps memory to disk when RAM is full
* High I/O wait (`wa`): 9.7% - the system is waiting on disk I/O (memory swapping)

### Memory

```bash
MiB Mem :   7750.7 total,    403.6 free,   5580.2 used,   2156.9 buff/cache
```

Memory exhausted?, no : Only 132 MB free out of 7.7 GB total

## Other CPU analysis

```bash
# Check resource usage of pods on that node
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces --sort-by=cpu --field-selector spec.nodeName=kube-server-01.eraldy.com
# Script failed use the global debug flag ie (kubee --debug kubectl) to get more information

ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -20

```

## K3s-server as Top process

k3s as highest CPU user per top

k3s-server using 232% CPU and 2.1 GB RAM - this is abnormally high

Check the log for any error

```bash
journalctl -u k3s -f --since "15 minutes ago"
# or ?
journalctl -e -u k3s
```

Check the database size [for vaccum / compaction error](../k3s/datastore-sqlite.md)
